## ðŸŒ» Ihlaam Abrahams
I am a BSc Honours Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria. In my undergraduate degree I studied BSc Information and Knowledge systems with
a major in Business Studies. This collaboration is something I find very interesting and necessary in the larger context of working and developing IT systems for 
companies. Lately I have also been finding interest in cybersecurity and digital forensics, which is what my research project is based on, and hope to pursure
these fields a bit more.
